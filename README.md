Fe-Co-Ni alloy database consisting of magnetic and electrical properties

Magnetic Properties:
  1. **Saturation Induction**: The maximum intrinsic induction possible in a material. Also known as **saturation flux density**. Intrinsic induction is the vector difference
     between the magnetic flux density at a given point and the magnetic flux density which would exist there, for the same magnetic field strength, if the point were in a
     vacuum.
     **Unit - Tesla (T)**
  2. **Coercivity**: Coercivity, also called the magnetic coercivity, coercive field or coercive force, is a measure of the ability of a ferromagnetic material to withstand an 
     external magnetic field without becoming demagnetized.
     **Unit - Ampere/metre (A/m)**
  3. **Maximum Permeability**: The maximum permeability is the point where the slope of the B/H curve for the unmagnetized material is the greatest. This point is often taken as 
     the point where a straight line from the origin is tangent to the B/H curve.
  4. **Curie Temperature**: The Curie temperature, also known as Curie point, is the temperature at which the ferromagnetic element starts to lose its magnetism and becomes
     paramagnetic when this temperature is exceeded.
     **Unit - Kelvin (K)**

Electrical Property:
  1. **Electrical Resistivity**: Electrical resistivity is a fundamental property of a material that measures how strongly it resists electric current.
     **Unit - Micro-ohm Centimeter (μΩ·cm)**
